## Installation

By default, this application runs on port 5001. If you change the port the application deploys on, the application will still deploy and the Angular application will still be served but the API calls to retrieve the operators for the calculator and the API call to perform the application will not function.

To medigate this, you will need to change the port

Upon code clone/fork/download, you will need to install the npm depencies as specified by the package.json file. To do so, in the command line interface navigate to Calculator-api/API/Client and run: npm install.
